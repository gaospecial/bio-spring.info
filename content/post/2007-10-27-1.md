1\. Sleep now, Dream will come out; Study now, Dream will come true  
2. My wasteful today is the tomorrow those losers begging for.  
3. The earliest moment is when you think it's too late.  
4   Better do it today than tomorrow.  
5   The pain of study is temporary, the pain of not study is lifelong  
6   You do not lack time to study, you are lacking the efforts  
7   There might not be a ranking of happiness but there is surely a
ranking of success.  
8   Study is one but not the only component of your life, but if you
cannot even overcome this single component, what can you overcome?  
9   Please enjoy the pain if it is unavoidable  
10 Get up early, Grind out hardy, Gain on success  
11 Nobody success easily without complete self-control and strong
perseverance  
12 Time passes by  
13 Today's slaver will drain into tomorrow's tear  
14 Study like a Dog; Play like a gentalman!  
15 Stop walking today and you'll have to run tomorrow  
16 People who invest the future are the true realists.  
17 Education equals income  
18 Today never comes back  
19 Even at this very moment your competitors will not stop flipping
pages.  
20 No pain, No gain
