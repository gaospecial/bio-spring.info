'Virophage' suggests viruses are alive

The discovery of a giant virus that falls ill through infection by
another
virus<sup>[1](http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080807/full/454677a.html#B1)</sup>
is fuelling the debate about whether viruses are alive.

“There’s no doubt this is a living organism,” says Jean-Michel Claverie,
a virologist at the the CNRS UPR laboratories in Marseilles, part of
France’s basic-research agency. “The fact that it can get sick makes it
more alive.”
