The Massive RT-PCR Primer Designer is based on Primer3 and BioPerl
toolbox, and was derived from the standalone codes which have been
discussed by two previous blog posts ([Post
1](http://bio-spring.top/rt-primer-bioperl/) and [Post
2](http://bio-spring.top/primer_error-missing-sequence-tag/)).

You may access the service at [The Massive RT-PCR Primer
Designer](http://tools.bio-spring.top/rtprimers.cgi).

What this tool needs is your fasta file, which contains one or more
nucleotide sequences that will be use as PCR template. Upload this file
and the tool will generate the most ideal primer pairs suitable for
quantitive Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). The primers will be supplied as a
downloadable Excel file.

Notably, the amplicon size of these RT-PCR primers are spanning from 150
bp to 250 bp.

Powered by AliYun, the service is available at 7×24h.
