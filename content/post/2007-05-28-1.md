Well, I mean, speaking as a completely objective third-party outsider
with absolutely no personal interst in the matter, I am not sure that
you an Olivia really mesh well together. You know... I mean... but you
an Viola ...I mean... be magic!

It's just like what coach says before every game:"Be not afraid of
greatness. Some are born great. Some achieve greatness. And some have
greatness thrust upon them." I think the best chance for us to be great
here today is to have you play.

Well, a few days ago, I kissed this girl at a kissing booth. And now I
just can't seem to stop thinking about it. Plus, I miss my roommate. I
really like him.
